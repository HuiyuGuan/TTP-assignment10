    Download and install PostgreSQL on your devices (for Mac users I recommend the app)
  </li>
  <li>Using Figma/Lucidchart, create an ER Diagram of your database</li>
  <li>Create a brand new database with a specific topic (eg pizza, students, employees, etc.) with 
  <br>At least four different tables.
  <br> Each table should have a primary key
  <br> Each table should have at least four dummy tuples
  <br> Each table should be able to be joined with one other table in the database (this will make sense once you understand schemas)
  </li>
  <li>Write an inner join query that joins two tables, one that joins three tables and one that joins all four tables (you can stack inner joins)</li>
  <li>Finally using Postman*, try to post a brand new line of data and get two different lines of dummy data that you placed inside the database.
</li>
</ul>
